# Smart Photo Gallery
### Full-stack web application built for home servers

This project allows users to upload photos to their home server from a web frontend and automatically analyze image backgrounds using a deep learning model trained on the MIT places365 dataset. The user can then search through their photos by background scene (e.g. "beach," "mountain," "forest," etc.) and view all images in an organized gird.
